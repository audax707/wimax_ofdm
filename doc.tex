\maketitle
\section{Project Overview}
We are developing a minimal 802.16-2009 OFDM Transmitter PHY.  This PHY
supports only QPSK-1/2 modulation-convolution rate. Additionally, any
components not relevant to unlicensed bands are omitted.  All optional items
are omitted.

This PHY requires the cooperation of a MAC layer implimentation which is
compliant with the 802.16-2009 standard in order for the compliance
expectations (\autoref{sec:comply}) to be met.

	\subsection{End Market Expectations}
	Currently IEEE 802.16, also known as ``WiMAX'', has seen little
	deployment in the United States and western Europe while being
	moderately deployed in Asian nations and Eastern European markets.
	To be useful in western areas, WiMAX has to effectively compete
	with both consumer owned Wifi hot-spots and the various cell phone
	networks. Given the impressively low cost of both cellular and Wifi
	(802.11) systems combined with the expectation that they work well
	in mobile devices, this physical layer (PHY) targets both
	simplicity (to reduce cost) and reduced power consumption.

	\subsection{Degree of standards compliance and scope limitations}
	\label{sec:comply}
	The 802.16 standard specifies multiple layers of a WiMAX device,
	including a ``Service-specific convergence sublayer'' (Section 5),
	a MAC sublayer (Section 6), a Security sublayer (Section 7), and
	the Physical layer (Section 8). While the PHY is described within
	section 8 of the 802.16-2009 document, other sections may apply to
	the design of the PHY and thus were considered to the minimal
	extent to which they apply to design of the PHY component.  Within
	the PHY layer, implementers are further given the choice of three
	(3) different PHY types: SC (single carrier), OFDM (orthogonal
	frequency division multiplexing), and OFDMA (orthogonal frequency
	division multiple access). In the interest of developing a product
	which is applicable to the larger consumer market and follows with
	our design goal of simplicity, OFDM was chosen as the modulation
	method to be implemented as it is significantly simpler in design
	than OFDMA and is designed for use on unlicensed and licensed
	bands. OFDM is detailed in section 8.3 of the 802.16-2009 document.

	Applicable sections of the IEEE 802.16-2009 standard.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Section 8.3 - OFDM description
		\item Section 8.3.3.4.1 - Data Modulation: implimenation
			is not compliant with this section, only QPSK
			modulation is supported.
		\item 8.3.3.4.3 - Rate ID encodings: not compliant with
			this section, only the QPSK-1/2 rate ID is supported.
		\item 8.3.5.1.1 - DL subchannelization: Rate ID
	\end{itemize}
\section{Electrical Characteristics}
All voltages of logic levels are defined by the FPGA on which the product's
code is placed.

\section{Burst Interface}
\label{sec:burst}
	

\section{Internal Interfaces}
This section covers the interfaces for internal structures within the PHY
transmitter which are not exposed for use by the MAC or any other interfacing
hardware.

Each block of the transmitter connected via direct wiring (without a
buffer) is given the same clock. Each block reads its inputs on alternating
clock edges such that two adjacent units read and write on different edges.
This is done so that outputted data does not change while being read.
Except where explicitly mentioned, reading of an input bit stream is done
on the positive clock edge only when the corresponding \textbf{load\_*}
control line is high.  All PHY components are clocked via the
\textbf{phy\_clock}. All wires noted as \textbf{enable}s (also:
'\textbf{en}') are active high, and remain high for the duration where the
input stream is valid. Others indicated as \textbf{flag}s are set on the
first clock where they are valid, and will be cleared on the next unless
reasserted by the sending hardware.

	\subsection{MAC - PHY interface}
	\label{sec:mac_phy}

	The MAC interfaces with the PHY module by sending frames (with the
	appropriate headers and padding included) as a stream of bits.
	These bits are clocked via the \textbf{mac\_clk\_in} line, and must
	only be sent when the \textbf{mac\_sending\_frame} line is high.
	The state of the \textbf{mac\_sending\_frame} line must be low when
	not sending a frame, and must be lowered and raised between frames
	that would otherwise be abutting. The frequency of
	\textbf{mac\_clk\_in} must be less than or equal to half of the
	\textbf{phy\_clock}.

	The \textbf{phy\_ready} line is a signal to the mac that it is
	ready for a new frame to be inputed, and should not be ignored.

	The structure of individual frames detailed in section 8.3.5 of
	IEEE 802.16-2009.  Each frame contains a header, up to 4 DL
	subframes (each with their own structure also defined in
	IEEE802.16-2009 section 8.3.5) and some number of UL subframes.
	Note that due to fixing certain implimentation parameters, some
	fields are constrained further than mentioned within the standard. 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Frame Header - Rate\_ID] is fixed at '1' indicating
			QPSK modulation with a code rate of $1 over 2$.
		\item[]
	\end{description}

	\subsection{Header Decoder}
	\label{sec:header}
	The Randomizer (\autoref{sec:rand}) requires the locations of the
	PDUs (packet data units, 2 per frame) within each frame as well as
	the locations of 'Bursts' within each PDU to reinitialize itself at
	various points in the bit stream. As all of this data is contained
	in the PDU headers, this block determines the values of the needed
	fields and forwards them to the Control Logic block
	(\autoref{sec:ctrl}). 

	This block has the unique challenge of additionally reading it's
	bit-stream at the clock specified by the MAC,
	\textbf{mac\_bit\_clk\_in}.

	\begin{description}
		\item{Inputs:} \begin{description}
			\item[bits\_to\_phy], input bitstream,  clocked via
				\textbf{mac\_bit\_clk\_in}.  No enable
				used. Uses \textbf{mac\_frame\_flag} to
				determine when a new frame is inbound.
			\item[mac\_bit\_clk\_in], as idicated above.
		\end{description}
		\item{Outputs:} \begin{description}
			\item[bits\_to\_rand] is the output bitstream.
			\item[en\_to\_rand] indicates the output bitstream
				is valid.
			\item[??] all of the data in some format, sent to
				the control logic so that it can reset the
				randomizer at the appropriate times and
				forward the subchannelization data to other
				blocks of logic.
		\end{description}
	\end{description}

	\subsection{Randomizer}
	\label{sec:rand}
	The randomizer operates as a shift register with an initial value
	determined by the PDU (packet data unit, one half of a frame) header
	and whether it is a UL (uplink) or DL (downlink) PDU.

	\begin{description}
		\item{Inputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[bits\_to\_rand], the input bitsream
			\item[en\_to\_rand], indicates the input bitsream
				is valid.
			\item[reset\_rand], indicates a reload of the
				register is needed, only high for a single
				bit. Causes the reading of \textbf{rand\_iv}
				into an internal register.
			\item[rand\_iv{[15]}], a new vector to load into
				the shift register.
		\end{description}
		\item{Outputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[bits\_to\_fec], bit stream clocked via the
				main clock.
			\item[en\_to\_fec], indicates that the incomming
				bitstream is valid.
		\end{description}
	\end{description}

	Estimated Gates: 1k \\
	Responsible Person: Cody.

	\subsection{Forward Error Correction}
		\label{sec:fec}
		This is a Reed-Solomon and convolution coding combination
		which is applied per frame. Within the standard, different
		RS (Reed-Solomon) codes and CC (convolution code) rates are
		used for varying modulation types. As we have fixed the
		modulation and code rate to QPSK-1/2, one two of the RS
		code and CC rate pairs are needed, as indicated in the
		\autoref{tbl:fec}.
		
		\begin{table*}
			\begin{tabular}{p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}|p{2cm}}
			\label{tbl:fec}
				Modulation & Uncoded block size (bytes) &
				Coded block size (bytes) & Overall coding
				rate & RS code & CC code rate \\ \hline
				QPSK & 24 & 48 & 1/2 & (32,24,4) & 2/3 \\
			\end{tabular}
			\caption{Forward Error correction rates}
		\end{table*}

		\begin{description}
			\item{Inputs:} \begin{description}
				\item[bits\_to\_fec], from header decoder
					(\autoref{sec:header})
				\item[en\_to\_fec], indicates the incomming
					bitstream is valid.
			\end{description}
			\item{Outputs:} \begin{description}
				\item[bits\_from\_fec], output bitstream
				\item[en\_from\_fec], set high to indicate
					output bitstream is valid.
			\end{description}
		\end{description}

		Estimated Gates: 2k \\
		Responsible Person: Luke.

	\subsection{FEC to Interleaving Circular buffer}
		\label{sec:fec_buffer}

		\begin{description}
			\item{Inputs:} \begin{description}
				\item[bits\_from\_fec]
				\item[en\_from\_fec], indicates the incomming
					bitstream is valid
				\item[fec\_buf\_adv\_flag] set high for a
					single clock cycle by the consumer to
					indicate it has consumed the
					presently outputed data block.
			\end{description}
			\item{Outputs:} \begin{description}
				\item[fec\_buffer\_flag], 
				\item[fec\_buffer\_out{[96]}], set high to indicate
					output bitstream is valid.
			\end{description}
		\end{description}

		Takes \textbf{bits\_from\_fec} (triggered via
		\textbf{en\_from\_fec}) and places them in a circular
		buffer. When the number of buffered bits equals the block
		size of the Interleaver (set at 96 bytes or 768 bits), the
		\textbf{fec\_buffer\_done} flag is set. Data is outputted
		via \textbf{fec\_buffer\_out[96]}

		Estimated Gates: 1K \\
		Responsible Person: Cody

	\subsection{Interleaving}
		\label{sec:interleaving}

		Two step type operation, swaps bits around.

		Estimated Gates: 2K \\
		Responsible Person: John

	\subsection{Constellation Mapping}
		\label{sec:constellation}

		Input is bit stream, output is (I,Q).
		
		Estimated Gates: 4K \\
		Responsible Person: Luke

	\subsection{Pilot Subcarrier Insertion}
		\label{sec:pilot}

		Input is (I,Q) pair, output is (I,Q) pair with pilot subcarriers
		inserted at some points (fixed).

		Estimated Gates: 1K \\
		Responsible Person: Cody

	\subsection{Subcarrier to IFFT Buffer}
		\label{sec:ifft-buffer}
		Insertion into this buffer is ordered but will have random
		jumps around different UL \& DL bursts.

		Block Size = blk\_siz = 200 (the total number of used
		subcarriers)
		
		Buffers blk\_size items each of which has width 2 bits.
		QPSK utilizes both I and Q, amplitude and phase, each with
		a granularity of 2. This means that each item (a pair of I
		\& Q) has 4 possible values and thus 2 bits are needed for
		each.

		Estimated Gates: 2k \\
		Responsible Person: Cody.

	\subsection{IFFT}
	\label{sec:ifft}
	IFFT Size: 256 items (each being a complex number)
	\begin{description}
		\item{Inputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_buf\_has\_block] The count of the last
				block present in the Sub to IFFT buffer
				(\autoref{sec:ifft-buffer})
			
			\item[ifft\_buf\_data{[200][2][??ndepth]}] access
				to the data at the present 'tail' location
				in the buffer
		\end{description}
		
		\item{Outputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_data\_ready] high when the IFFT has
				processed data.
		\end{description}
	\end{description}

	Estimated Gates: 10k.
	Responsible Person: John.

	\subsection{Cyclic Prefix}
	\label{sec:cyclic_prefix}
	\begin{description}
		\item{Inputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_done] indicates the IFFT has
				data to be read out.
			\item[ifft\_data] : single bit of data from
				the IFFT.
		\end{description}
		\item{Outputs:}
		\begin{description}
			\item[ifft\_shift\_clk] clocks out the data from the IFFT.
			\item[bits\_cyclic\_appended{[2]}]: sequence of
				I\&Q with the prefix appended.
				This is sent directly to the ADC.
		\end{description}
	\end{description}

	Appends the last Tg items of the previous frame to the start of the
	present frame.  Reads 256 2 bit items from the IFFT, appending Tg
	items to the start of it. It also stores the last Tg items so that
	they may be appended to the next frame from the IFFT.

	Size is fixed at ??

	Estimated Gates: 2k.
	Responsible Person: John.

\section{FPGA Implementation}
  \subsection{Sampling and Clock Rate}
    From the IEEE 802.16 standards document, the sampling rate for 256-OFDM is defined as
    \begin{equation}
    F_s = BW * 7/6
    \end{equation}
  
  \begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{c|c}
  Channel Bandwidth & Sampling Rate \\ \hline
  14 MHz & 16.333 MHz \\
  7 MHz & 8.166 MHz \\
  3.5 MHz & 4.083 MHz \\
  1.75 MHz & 2.042 MHz
  \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  
  This design should be able to run on both the Spartan-3 FPGA and Virtex 4 LX60
  FPGA as they both supply a 500 MHz clock.
  
  \subsection{Power Calculation}
  
  Calculate power based on required clock frequency for the device as well as the
  FPGA specifications for voltage inputs.
  
  Absolute Maximum rating for $V_{in}$ : 4.4 V
  
  Clock frequency required for a 3.5 MHz channel bandwidth : 4.083 MHz
  
  Input capacitance over recommended operating conditions : 10 pF
  \begin{center}
  \begin{equation}
  P = C * V^2 * f = 10 pF * (4.4 V)^2 * 4.083 MHz = 0.18 mW
