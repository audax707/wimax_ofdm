\section{Project Overview}
	\subsection{End Market Expectations}
	Currently IEEE 802.16, also known as “WiMAX”, has seen little deployment in the
	United States and western Europe while being moderately deployed in Asia
	nations and Eastern European markets. To be useful in western areas, WiMAX has
	to effectively compete with both consumer owned Wifi hot-spots and the various
	cell phone networks. Given the impressively low cost of both cellular and Wifi
	(802.11) systems combined with the expectation that they work well in mobile
	devices, this physical layer (PHY) targets both simplicity (to reduce cost) and
	reduced power consumption.

	\subsection{Degree of standards compliance and scope limitations}
	The 802.16 standard specifies multiple layers of a WiMAX device, including a
	“Service-specific convergence sublayer” (Section 5), a MAC sublayer (Section
	6), a Security sublayer (Section 7), and the Physical layer (Section 8). While
	the PHY is described within section 8 of the 802.16-2009 document, other
	sections may apply to the design of the PHY and thus were considered to the
	minimal extent to which they apply to design of the PHY component.  Within the
	PHY layer implementers are further given the choice of three (3) different PHY
	types: SC (single carrier), OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing),
	and OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access). In the interest of
	developing a product which is applicable to the larger consumer market and
	follows with our design goal of simplicity, OFDM was chosen as the modulation
	method to be implemented as it is significantly simpler in design than OFDMA
	and is designed for use on unlicensed and licenced bands. OFDM is detailed in
	section 8.3 of [1]

	FFT size fixed at 256

\section{Product Description}
	\subsection{Device Usage}
	This device implements only the PHY layer of the IEEE 802.16 standard, and
	therefore it requires an existing MAC implementation to process its I/O. As can
	be seen from Figures 1 and 2 %[needs reference to section Block Diagram] , both
	the Transmitter and Receiver require MAC level inputs into the Control Logic
	blocks for the PHY implementation to function correctly.

	\subsubsection{Transmitter MAC/PHY}
	The transmitter portion of this device requires multiple inputs into the
	Control Logic block as well as the frame(s) to be transmitted by the device
	from the MAC.  The Control Block will send a “Ready for Frame” signal to the
	MAC to indicate that the PHY layer is ready to receive a frame. As the MAC
	sends the frame to a Header Parser block, it also sends a Sending frame signal
	to the Control Block. The Header Parser block takes the frame and sends
	relevant information from the frame header to the Control Logic block. The
	frame is then passed on to the first operating block of the PHY layer, the
	Randomizer.

\subsection{Transmitter PHY}
All voltages of logic levels are defined by the FPGA on which the product's
code is placed.

Each block of the transmitter connected via direct wiring (without a buffer)
is given the same clock. Except where explicitly mentiond, reading of an input
bit stream is done on the positive clock edge only when the corresponding
$load\_*$ control line is high. All PHY componets are clocked via the
$phy\_clock$.

	\subsubsection{MAC - PHY interface}
	The MAC interfaces with the PHY module by sending frames (with the
	appropriate headers and padding included) as a stream of bits. These
	bits are clocked via the $mac\_clk\_in$ line, and must only be sent
	when the $mac\_sending\_frame$ line is high. The state of the
	$mac\_sending\_frame$ line must be low when not sending a frame, and
	must be lowered and raised between frames that would otherwise be
	abutting. The frequency of $mac\_clk\_in$ must be less than
	half of the $phy\_clock$ unless both clocks share their phase, in
	which case $mac\_clk\_in$ may be equal to the full $phy\_clock$.

	The $phy\_ready$ line is a signal to the mac that it is ready for a
	new frame to be inputed, and should not be ignored.

	\subsubsection{Header Decoder}
	The \cite{Randomizer} requires the locations of the PDUs (packet data
	units, 2 per frame) within each frame as well as the locations of
	'Bursts' within each PDU to reinitialize itself at various points in
	the bit stream. As all of this data is contained in the PDU headers,
	this block determines the values of the needed fields and forwards
	them to the \cite{Control Logic} block.

	This block has the unique chalenge of additionally reading it's
	bitstream at the clock specified by the MAC, $mac\_clk\_in$.

	Bit stream in: $mac\_bits$, clocked via $mac\_clk\_in$.
	No enable used. Reset via $header\_reset$. Bit stream out:
	$bits\_norm$ (indicating their clocking is now normalized).

	\subsubsection{Randomizer}
	The randomizer operates as a shift register with an initial value
	determined by the PDU (packet data unit, one half of a frame) header
	and whether it is a UL (uplink) or DL (downlink) PDU.
